You just seem like, you know, kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I, uh...I fell through some thin ice and I'm telling you, water that cold, like right down there, it hits you like a thousand knives stabbing you all over your body. You can't breathe. You can't think, least not about anything but the pain, which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in there after you. Like I said, I don't have a choice.

Stupid, really. I was leaning over and I slipped. I was leaning far over to see the...\nD: Propellers?\nB: Propellers, and I slipped. And I would have gone overboard, but Mr. Dawson here saved me and almost went over himself.\nD: She wanted to see the propellers.\nE: I got to say, women and machinery do not mix.\nF: Was that the way of it?\nA: Yeah, that was pretty much it.\nE: Well, the boy's a hero, then.

But fourthly, now that I know him, I would say I actually do wanna be friends with Auggie. At first, I admit it. I was only friendly to him because my mom asked me to be nice. But now I would choose to hang out with him. Like, he is a good friend.

Dear Mr. Tushman, I'm very sorry for punching Julian. It was wrong of me to do that. I know you may need to expel me, but I'd rather not say why I did what I did. It might get Julian in trouble, too and that's not fair.\nK: Stop! Sincerely, Jack Will. Dear Mr. Will, one thing I've learned in 20 years in education is that there are two sides to every story. So I think I can imagine what started the fight. While nothing justifies striking another student, I know good friends are worth defending. So, after your 2-day suspension, your scholarship will be waiting for you. Just keep up the good work and keep being the fine boy we all know you to be.

Some couples do survive these things, you know. I googled it. “Staying together after the affair.” And a lot of couples, I mean, a lot stay together. And anyway, there is something to be said about moving through it and focusing on us and not on the affair. I don't want to give up on him. I know him, and I know he knows better.

It was all his idea. I'm sure that's why I'm even considering this whole CEO thing, thinking maybe someone else coming in will help me get my life back on track.\nB: Okay, that...that's it.

And so I was doing that. And through the mist, I could see my grandmother. And she was just standing there, smiling at me. And uh, then I held it there for a long time and I looked at her. And then finally, I let go of the nozzle, you know? And then I dropped the hose and she disappeared. And so I went back inside and I tell my parents. And they sit me down and give me this big rap on how when people die, you never see them again, and how I'd imagined it. But I knew what I'd seen. I was glad I saw that.

I have no idea what your situation is, but, uh, I feel like we have some kind of, uh, connection. Right?\nB: Yeah, me too.\nA: Yeah, right. Well, great. So listen, here's the deal. This is what we should do. You should get off the train with me here in Vienna. Come to check out the town.\nB: What?\nA: Come on. It'll be fun. Come on.\nB: What would we do?\nA: Umm, I don't know. All I know is I have to catch an Austrian Airlines flight tomorrow morning at 9:30 and I don't really have enough money for a hotel, so I was just going to walk around, and it would be a lot more fun if you came with me.

Oh, my God, Amy.\nB: I know.\nA: I'm so sorry.\nB: Thank you.\nB: You know, just like after eight years...I can't believe how petty the argument was that actually ended it. We came home and he told me to, um, put my shoes by the door where he liked to put the shoes. And I didn't want to be told where to put my shoes. I wanted to sit on the sofa and relax for a second. So we fought about that for like 10 minutes. And I'm like, “You are overwhelming,” and he said, “I'm just trying to make a home.” And I was like, “I'm trying, you know?” And he's like, “You're not trying.” All I'm doing is trying, but I'm not trying the way that he wants me to trying. And he's like trying to control the way that I'm trying. It's...We've had that argument, like, 100 times. And I just had to finally stop, you know? I had to finally stop. I just...Hooo, I just couldn't do it anymore. I couldn't...I couldn't be in that place anymore where we just made each other feel like shit about ourselves.\nA: Yeah.\nB: And so I said: “I'm going to bed and I don't want to be married anymore.”\nA: Wow.\nB: I feel, um, relieved. I feel like I just have so much energy, you know. And I just want to move forward. I don't care who I disappoint. You know, I know that makes me an awful person. Now my parents, they're upset because my marriage is falling apart and they're putting it on me. And they're just like...\nA: Yeah, you're always...You're always gonna disappoint somebody.\nB: Exactly. For me, I feel good. I even made a new friend. I have a friend.\nA: Hahaha.\nB: And the absurd thing is, she's actually an operating system. Charles left her behind, but she's totally amazing. You know, she's so smart. She doesn't just see things in black or white. She sees this whole gray area and she's helping me explore it and we just bonded really quickly, you know? At first, I thought it was because that's how they were programmed, but I don't think that's the case. Because I know this guy who's hitting on his OS and she like totally rebuffs him. I'm weird. That's weird, right? That I'm bonding with an OS. No, it's okay. It's weird.\nA: Heh. Well, I don't think so. Actually the woman that I've been seeing, Samantha...I didn't tell you, heh...but she is an OS.\nB: Really? You're dating an OS? What is that like?\nA: It's great, actually. Yeah, I mean, I feel really close to her. Like, when I talk to her, I feel like she's with me, you know? And when we're cuddling at night, when the lights are off and we're in bed, I feel cuddled.\nB: Wait. Are you falling in love with her?\nA: Does that make me a freak?\nB: No, no, I think it's...I think anybody who falls in love is a freak. It's a crazy thing to do. It's kind of like a form of socially acceptable insanity.\n"},function(e,o,t){"use strict";t.r(o),o.default="\nA: Good morning.\nB: Hey.\nA: What's wrong?\nB: How can you tell something's wrong? \nA: I don't know.

And we're not gonna be together and we're not together, but we're friends still. And she's not angry.\nA: Is she angry?\nB: Yeah.\nA: Why?\nB: I think I hid myself from her and left her alone in the relationship.\nA: Hmm. Why haven't you gotten divorced yet?\nB: I don't know. I think for her. It's just a piece of paper. It doesn't mean anything.\nA: And what about for you?\nB: I'm not ready. I like being married.\nA: Yeah, but you haven't really been together for almost a year.\nB: But you don't know what it's like to lose someone you care about.\nA: Yeah. You're right. I'm sorry.\nB: No, don't apologize. I'm sorry. You're right. I keep waiting to not care about her.\nA: Oh, Theodore. That's hard. You hungry?\nB: Not right now.\nA: Cup of tea?\nB: No.\nA: Do you wanna try getting out of bed? Mopey? Come on. You can still wallow in your misery.

I just want to get it done, you know? Sign the papers, be divorced and just move forward.\nA: That's great. Theodore. That must feel so good. I'm so happy for you.\nB: Me, too. So I'm meeting her Wednesday to do it.\nA: Oh. Hmmm. Are those things usually done in person?\nB: No, but, you know, we fell in love together and we got married together and it's important to me that we do this together.\nA: Oh. Right. Good.\nB: Are you okay?\nA: Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm okay. I'm happy for you. It's just...I guess I'm just thinking about how you're gonna see her and she's very beautiful and incredibly successful. And you were in love with her, and she has a body.\nB: And we're getting divorced.\nA: I know, I know. I'm being silly.\nB: Uh-huh. So I'm available.\nC: Wow, here we are.\nB: I'm glad we could do this in person. I know you've been traveling a lot.\nC: No, I'm really glad you suggested it.\nB: I signed all the papers. I put them for you to sign.\nC: What's the rush?\nB: Yeah, I know. I'm a really slow signer, I realized. It took me three months just to write the letter T. And are you happy with your new book?\nC: Um, you know how I am. I mean, I feel like it's true to what I set out to do, so I'm happy about that.\nB: I'm sure it's amazing. I remember that paper that you wrote in school.\nC: Ha, ha.\nB: It made me cry.\nC: Yeah, but everything makes you cry.\nB: Everything you make makes me cry.\nC: So are you, um...Are you seeing anybody?\nB: Yeah. Um. I've been seeing somebody for the last few months.\nC: Well, you seem really good.\nB: Thanks. I am. Um, at least, I'm doing better. Yeah, she's been really good for me, you know? It's good to be with somebody that's excited about life. She is a real, um...\nC: Huh.\nB: No, I mean, I wasn't in such a good place myself and in that way, it's been nice.\nC: I think you always wanted me to be this light, happy, bouncy, “Everything's fine.” L.A. wife and that's just not me.\nB: I didn't want that.\nC: So, what's she like?\nB: Well, her name is Samantha, and she's an operating system. She's really complex and interesting, and...\nC: Wait, I'm sorry. You're dating your computer?\nB: She's not just a computer. She's her own person. She doesn't just do whatever I say.\nC: I didn't say that. But it does make me very sad that you can't handle real emotions, Theodore.\nB: They are real emotions. How would you know what...?\nC: What? Say it. Am I really that scary? Say it. How do I know what?\nD: How are you guys doing here?\nC: We're fine. We're fine. We used to be married but he couldn't handle me. Wanted me on Prozac. Now he's madly in love with his laptop.\nD: If you heard the conversation in context, what I was trying to say...\nC: You always wanted to have a wife without the challenges of actually dealing with anything real.

Was it Maria?\nB: No. It is a farm, isn't it?\nA: Yes.\nB: Is it to do with your new job?\nD: All you need to know about my work here, Bruno is that it's very important to our country and to you. We're working very hard to make this world a better place for you to grow up in. \nB: But you're not a farmer. You're a soldier.\nA: Bruno, can you come and help me finish sorting out in the kitchen?\nB: I can still play with them, though? The children.\nA: I don't think so, Bruno. No. Like you say, they're a bit strange. A bit some...Well, they're different. Don't worry, my darling. We'll find you some new friends, but they won't be the ones from the farm.\nB: Hello.

It's not fair, me being stuck over here on my own while you're over there, playing with friends all day.\nE: Playing?\nB: Well, that number. Isn't it a part of a game or something?\nE: It's just my number. Everyone gets given a different number.\nB: Right.

My dad's a soldier, but not the sort that takes people's clothes away for no reason.\nE: What sort, then?\nB: Well, he's the important sort. He's in charge of making everything better for everyone. So is your dad a farmer?\nE: No, he's a watchmaker. Or was. Most of the time now, he just mends boots. I wish you'd remembered the chocolate.\nB: Yes, I'm sorry. I know. Perhaps you can come and have supper with us sometime.\nE: I can't, can I? Because of this.\nB: But that's to stop the animals getting out, isn't it?\nE: Animals?

A nation's collapse is all down to this one man?\nB: The Jew here means the entire Jewish race. \nC: There is such thing as a nice Jew, though, isn't there?\nB: I think, Bruno, if you ever found a nice Jew, you would be the best explorer in the world.

See, at the moment your mother is finding it...She just feels right now you need to spend some time elsewhere. Would you like that? I'm afraid, Bruno, in life, we often have to do things we don't want to do. The important thing is your mother does not feel that this is an appropriate place for you to be spending your childhood and the more I think about it, the more I realize she's very probably right.\nC: But, Dad.\nE: No!

I couldn't wait until I got out. No more homework, no more books, no more teachers' dirty looks. My companion first showed up, when I was six, but it was years before it had a name. Now the shrinks said I was just hyper. I made funny noises and acted weird to draw attention to myself. It was just a phase: I'd grow out of it and be “normal”, like everybody else. Through it all, my constant companion stuck with me. \nB: Afternoon, officer. Was I speeding?\nC: Twelve miles over the limit. St. Louis, huh? You a tourist?\nB: Uh, no. I live in Atlanta now. I just moved here. I guess I was a little distracted.\nC: Son, you been drinking?\nB: No, no, sir. I have Tourette Syndrome.\nC: Take it easy, son. I'm going to need you to sign this.

That's in Illinois, isn't it?\nB: Yes, ma'am.\nD: Your student teaching evals scores are outstanding, excellent. What made you decide to go into teaching?\nB: Uh, it's all I've ever wanted to do.

Maybe we should talk about the elephant.\nD: Elephant?\nB: In the room: my Tourette's.\nD: No. The Americans with Disabilities Act doesn't allow me to ask you...\nD: I know, but I'd like to tell you just like I tell the kids in my classes. See, I explain to them that it's a brain thing that causes me to make strange noises. They're like sneezes, irrepressible. When you have to, you have to. \nD: How do they react?\nB: Once they understand, they're fine with it. It's never caused any problems in a classroom. All I want is a chance. Just get me the interviews and let me prove to them that I can do the job.

It's about time you started meeting some chicks.\nB: I can't focus on dating right now.\nE: Well, have fun focusing. After the first call, I got two more: three interviews with three principals.

As soon as I can.\nF: Well, we don't require it for entry level, but if you're serious about...\nB: I'm very serious. I want to make teaching my life.

For my third interview, I decided to avoid discussing about my Tourette's at all.\nB: Each week I like to send home a progress report to my students' parents.

Do you like making noises and upsetting people, Brad?\nC: No, sir.\nA: Then why do you do it?\nC: Because I have Tourette Syndrome.\nA: What's that?\nC: It's a thing in my brain that causes me to make weird noises.\nA: But you could control it if you wanted to, right?\nC: No, sir. It's a sickness.\nA: Well, why can't you just get cured?\nC: There isn't any cure. I don't like making noises any more than you like hearing them. They're even worse when I get stressed, when you don't accept that I can't stop them. But when I feel accepted, then they're not so bad. \nA: What can we do? And I mean everyone in this school. What can we do to help you, Brad?\nC: I just want to be treated like everybody else.\nA: Good job. Go sit down. A few words a little education, and it was like opening a door to a brand new world. Now some day, some way, I knew, Tourette's or no Tourette's, I was going to be a teacher. I had no choice but to prove that Tourette's would never get the best of me. lf I quit, I would be agreeing with everyone who ever told me I was barking up the wrong tree.\nD: Sorry about the air conditioning. Supposed to already be fixed by now.\nC: That's all right.\nD: Well, umm, your resume looks okay. And we do have an opening in fifth grade.\nC: OK.\nD: But I do have to tell you this is a tough place to work. We've got some really hard cases.\nC: Well, I take that as a challenge. I don't believe that any kid is hopeless. You know, they all want to learn. You can't ever give up. You just gotta find the right way to teach them. \nD: Ahh, you got something stuck in your throat? Would you like a drink?\nC: I have Tourette Syndrome.\nD: How do you expect to handle a bunch of wild students with a handicap like that?\nC: Well. By educating them. By letting them know it's okay to talk about it. It's okay to ask questions...\nD: These students would laugh at you. I just don't see how you could ever teach a class.\nC: I can teach. Look at my resume. Look at it. Ok? I was very successful as a student teacher. My Tourette's never posed a problem!\nD: You want to teach here, you're gonna have to refrain from making these noises in class.\nC: You know what? Thank you very much for the interview.\nD: But, don't you want the job?\nC: Yes, actually. I want it really bad. But I would never, ever work for a man who doesn't care about his students. So, I'll take my portfolio and, ahh, and take no more of your time. You got a great boss. Well, it was the worst interview I've ever had. All he could see when he looked at me was my Tourette's.\nE: Well, honey, if they can't see what a great teacher you'd be, that is their failure, not yours. \nC: Well, it sure seems like my failure.\nE: Well, if you say so. You know what? Why don't you just throw in the towel and come home, huh? I'll buy you a ticket.\nC: I'm not saying that.\nE: Really? That sounds like what you're saying. It sounds like you're letting Tourette's win.\nC: I am not letting Tourette's win!\nE: Really?\nC: Yes, really!

Well, it's, uh, oh, it's, it's all I ever wanted to be ever since I was in school.\nG: You must have had some pretty inspiring teachers.\nC: Ah, well. I had an inspiring principal Mr. Myer, but my teachers, they really only inspired me to be the kind of teachers they never were.\nF: What kind of teachers is that?\nC: One who makes it possible for a kid to learn even if he's different in a way, the, the best teacher I ever had was my Tourette's.\nG: You, you don't have to talk about that, Brad. \nC: No, it's OK. I make a point of being open about it. It's, uh, never off-limits to my students. They can ask me anything they want about it at any time.\nG: You must get some pretty interesting questions.\nC: Oh, yeah. Sometimes it gets really personal. \nF: I hope this question isn't too personal, Brad. Do you make those noises in your sleep?\nC: I don't know. I'm asleep. No, no, I don't tic in my sleep. When I'm relaxed, the noises give me a little bit of a break, like just now.\nG: Okay Brad. I want to hear more about your teaching philosophy.\nC: Yeah. I'd love to tell you about my teaching philosophy. We talked for nearly two hours. It was the best interview I'd ever had.\nF: Well, Brad, it was a pleasure to meet you.\nC: You, too. You, too.\nG: We've still got a few more teachers to interview. But we'll let you know when we've made a decision.\nC: Ok, great.\nF: Thank you.\nC: Thank you.

The kids are still so open-minded. They're open to everything. \nC: Yes, but you do manage to maintain a little discipline, right? While they're being so open? \nB: I do let them know what the boundaries are. Yes.\nA: So, Brad. What do you think is the most important thing you have to teach?\nB: Yeah. Ah, well. Besides the importance of reading and the value of math, that it's okay to be yourself. It's okay to color outside the lines if that's who you are.\nC: So it's okay to ignore the boundaries?\nB: No, and I didn't...\nC: I'm sorry but how can you expect kids to learn when you're doing that all the time?\nA: Oh. Come on, Brenda.\nB: No, no, no. It's OK. It's a valid question. I want to answer it. Before they know me, kids sometimes do think I'm just weird or even scary. But, once I educate them about my Tourette's and they see that Mr. Cohen is a real person who just happens to make funny noises. Well, then they accept me as a good teacher just like they accept all of you.\nA: Well, maybe we should all try to be more like second-graders. Does anyone have any other questions for Mr. Cohen? Brad thanks for coming in. The school will be in touch with you, so just be patient. The principal wanted to see me in his office, just like old times.\nD: Pretty noisy, huh?\nB: And yet somehow the kids manage, don't they?\nD: Yes, they do. They do. Hilarie and I discussed you with the teachers. And, we talked about how proud we are of teaching our kids to never let anything hold them back in life. And, Hilarie said that if we're gonna talk the talk, we need to walk the walk. She's waiting to show you your classroom. Welcome.\nE: Second grade is overcrowded so we've had to create a new class. Your kids are being taken out of other rooms, so some of them might be a little confused. They've already been in school for three weeks. There's your student roster. The fun starts Monday, Brad. Let me know if there's anything you need.\nB: I need everything.\nB: Did your teachers warn you that Mr. Cohen makes funny noises?\nF: Yeeesss.\nG: She said you have Tour-tour...\nB: Tourette Syndrome. OK. Anything you want to know about it, I want you to ask. Yes. \nH: Is it catching?\nB: No. Absolutely not. You have to be born with it, like I was.\nI: Does it hurt?\nB: Well, sometimes, like when my neck jerks. But the noises do not hurt at all. These are great questions, keep them coming. And, it's okay to ask me anything about Tourette's. Yes? \nJ: Can you go to movies?\nB: Yes, I can go to movies, but sometimes I get kicked out and that makes me sad.\nJ: What's the bunny's name?\nB: Wa-Wa-Waffle.\nK: Wa Wa Waffle!\nJ: His name is just Waffle!\nB: All right, guys. Any more questions about Tourette's? Anyone?\nJ: Are they ever gonna make you well, Mr. Cohen?\nB: Well. Right now there's no medicine that can cure Tourette's. But, it's okay. Cuz I've learned to accept it and I don't let it run my life.\nL: What can't you do? Like, can you not eat? \nB: I can eat. OK, I eat a lot. In fact, I can do anything anybody else can do except there is one thing that Mr. Cohen can never do.\nF: What?\nB: No, I can't.\nF: What is it?\nB: No, I just can't.\nF: Tell us.\nB: No.\nM: Tell us.\nF: Yeah, tell us.\nB: Mr. Cohen can never play hide and go seek. \nN: Why can't you play hide and seek?\nO: Cause they'd hear him, stupid.\nB: Well, that's the right answer but it's the wrong words, because there won't be any name-calling in Mr. Cohen's class. Excuse me? Where are you going?\nO: Bathroom.\nB: And what's your name?\nO: Thomas.\nB: OK. Well, Thomas, if you want to leave your seat, you have to ask for permission.\nB: The noise you just heard is the Tourette Syndrome I've been living with since I was six years old. I'm standing up here today because the love and support of a lot of people put me up here. My family, my school family, my students and all my friends. I owe this award to all of them. But I also owe it to the toughest, and, and most dedicated teacher I ever had: my Constant Companion. My Tourette's. Now, some of you may think that's pretty weird to thank a disability and calling it a great teacher. That's really weird. I mean, what could I possibly learn from a disability? Yes, Gaylon. \nP: You learned to keep going.\nB: Elli?\nN: You learned to not let it stop you.\nB: Yes, Thomas.\nO: You learned to not let it win!\nB: That's right. Coping with my Tourette's has taught me the most valuable lesson that anyone could ever learn. And that is to never let anything stop you from chasing your dream, from working or playing or falling in love. That's right. Coping with my Tourette's has taught me the most valuable lesson that...Yes, Thomas.\nO: Can you bring that award to show and tell on Monday?\n"},function(e,o,t){"use strict";t.r(o),o.default="\nA: Hey, Mr. Peanut Butter Cups.\nB: Hey, Mr. Could-Kill-Me-in-One-Punch.

She comes for breakfast because that's what she did on Sundays and October 13th was a Sunday. She has no idea it's more than a year later.\nB: She reads the newspaper though.\nD: lt's a special paper her father puts on their porch every night. lt's from the day of her accident.

You're a storyteller. Whenever you're ready.\nA: My aunt used to live in Paris. I remember, she used to come home and she would tell us these stories about being abroad and I remember, she told us that she jumped into the river once, barefoot. She smiled... Leapt without looking and tumbled into the Seine. The water was freezing. She spent a month sneezing but said she would do it again. Here's to the ones who dream, foolish as they may seem. Here's to the hearts that ache. Here's to the mess we make. She captured a feeling “sky with no ceiling, the sunset inside a frame”. She lived in her liquor and died with a flicker. I'll always remember the flame. Here's to the ones who dream, foolish as they may seem. Here's to the hearts that ache. Here's to the mess we make. She told me “A bit of madness is key.” “To give us new colors to see” “Who knows where it will lead us?” “And that's why they need us” So bring on the rebels, the ripples from pebbles, the painters, and poets, and plays. And here's to the fools who dream, crazy as they may seem. Here's to the hearts that break. Here's to the mess we make. I trace it all back to then. Her, and the snow, and the Seine. Smiling through it. She said she'd do it again.\nB: When do you find out?\nA: They said the next couple of days. But I'm not expecting to find anything out.\nB: You're gonna get it.\nA: I really might not.\nB: Yes, you are.\nA: I don't want to be disappointed.\nB: I know. I know.

It's your dream. \nA: What are you gonna do?\nB: I gotta follow my own plan. You know? Stay here and get my own thing going. I mean, you'll be in Paris. Good jazz there. And you love jazz now.

But your very human brain was miraculously intact. Theoretically, you should remember something.\nD: Oh. Well... It's still pretty blank. No, it's completely blank, actually.

At least until I can remember my real name?\nA: Mm-hmm.\nD: Thank you.\nA: Okay. Do you want to take a look?\nD: Yes. Why are there so many languages?\nA: Um, after the big war I told you about...\nD: The Fall.\nA: After The Fall, only Zalem was left... and survivors came here from all over the world. Everybody down here works for Zalem. The Factory, the Farms...\nD: Does anyone ever go up to Zalem? We should go.\nA: Nobody from down here ever goes up. It's a rule that's never broken.\nE: Who's the girl?\nA: My new assistant.\nE: I was surprised to see her in our daughter's body. You were supposed to have destroyed that years ago.\nA: I couldn't.\nE: Clearly. And did you tell her who you built that body for?\nA: Our daughter is dead, Chiren. You need to let it go.\nE: Oh. It's obviously not me that's clinging to something here.\nA: Didn't I tell you to be home before dark?\nE: What's the big deal? I just lost track of time.\nA: Yeah. Don't trust anyone. People do terrible things to each other here.\nE: What happened to your arm?\nA: Here, eat this.\nE: You okay?\nA: You still need proper nourishment for your brain.\nE: This was your daughter? You built this body for her?\nA: Her name was Alita. She was really looking forward to waking up with legs that could run. \nE: You built her a pair of fast legs.\nA: She never got to use them. She was murdered.\nE: What happened?\nA: A patient of mine came to the clinic one night, looking for drugs.\nA: “Hey, what are you doing there?” Alita couldn't get out of the way fast enough. Her mother, Chiren, couldn't deal with Alita's death. Maybe she just couldn't deal with me. It brought no peace. There were other demons like him out there and I felt somehow I was responsible for all of them. So I registered as a Hunter-Warrior. There's nothing noble about it.\nE: Did you ever find peace?\nA: I found you.\nE: I'm not your daughter. I don't know what I am.\nA: I do. This is your brain. A normal healthy teenage girl's brain, if there is such a thing. But this is your heart, part of your original core.\nE: So I've got a strong heart?\nA: You have a heart strong enough to power all of Iron City for years. This is lost technology.

And I have made the most important discovery of my career, the most important discovery of my life. It is only in the mysterious equations of love that any logical reasons can be found.

You fix the boats on a dock.\nA: Okay. It's a poor example, but you're still going.\nB: But what about Fred?\nA: What about him?\nB: You won't take care of him.

I would like to introduce you to our principal, Mrs. Davis.\nG: Good morning, first graders.\nE: Good morning, Mrs. Davis.\nG: Are you ready for a great year?\nE: Yes!\nC: Uh... Yes, Mary?\nB: She's the boss?\nC: Mrs. Davis is our principal. Mm-kay...\nB: Okay. Now I want you to get on your phone and call Frank and tell him to get me out of here!\nF: Wait a minute. That's the dad? I know him. I see him at Ferg's almost every Friday night.

I'm Bonnie Stevenson.\nA: Frank. How are you? Sorry about today. I know she got a little overexcited. I think it's just first day jitters.\nC: Sure. Yeah.\nA: We're running a little late actually. We gotta get going.\nC: Okay. I don't even wanna talk about that. I'll keep you just a minute.\nA: Okay.\nC: I think, I think your daughter...I think Mary might be gifted.\nB: For the record, I didn't wanna go to the stupid school in the first place. And the boy in the next row acts inappropriately for someone who's a child.\nA: I'm sorry. I'm still passive aggressively ignoring you.\nB: Other kids answer questions. They don't get into trouble.\nA: You didn't get in trouble for answering questions. You yelled at the principal. You know what? You're gonna find this interesting. So, I googled \"first graders who yell at the principal...\" and statistically, you're never gonna believe how many kids do it.\nB: How many? \nA: None.\nB: Frank, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.\nA: Yeah. right. You can't show off like that at school.\nB: I know.\nA: You promised you wouldn't, then the first day...\nB: I know, I know. I screwed up.\nB: Get a hold of yourself. For my Show and Tell, I have the most awesome cat in the history of time. Not only is his name Fred, but...He has just one eye. Uno. Go ahead and count, but I promise you, it's always one.\nH: How did he lose his eye?\nB: I don't know. I wasn't there. Just found him inside of a trash can next to a bottle of alcohol or something. He is a smart, smart cat, but no one realizes that. No one understands him. No one.\nE: Oh.\nI: Look out. Look out. Your little animals are escaping, dumbass.\nB: Hey! You should not be laughing! You did a mean thing to a little kid!\nI: What are you gonna do about it?\nA: Hey. Hey, you okay? You good? All right. \nG: How do we resolve this? You know, she could be expelled.\nA: God. I hope not. But if every other first-time offender was expelled, I guess fair is fair.\nG: Are you gonna take this seriously?\nA: Sure. You don't bluff me, I don't bluff you. \nG: Ms. Stevenson believes that your child is exceptional and has talents that our curriculum can't begin to challenge. It just so happens that I am good friends with the headmaster of the Oaks Academy for Gifted Education. He has always said that if I find that one in a million...\nA: And the one in a million has a $30,000 tuition.\nG: Mr. Adler, I can get your daughter a scholarship. Full ride. I wouldn't say it if I couldn't do it.\nA: I realize, putting that girl in that setting, you know, 99 times out of a 100, that's what you do. It's the Oaks. It's a great school. I looked into it. But this family has a history with those schools. And I think the last thing that little girl needs is reinforcement that she's different. Trust me, she knows. So...I think Mary, I think she's gotta be here. Today's a bad ending. You can't hit people. But a 12 year-old bullies a seven-year-old and she stands up? Do you know how important it is to me that she did that? You know how proud I am of her? Aren't you? So, I'm sorry. I wish I could take your offer, but Mary stays unless you kick her out.\nG: This is a mistake. We'll never be able to raise this child to the level of scholarship she deserves.\nA: Well, just dumb her down into a decent human being. Everybody wins.\n"},function(e,o,t){"use strict";t.r(o),o.default="\nA: Okay. Mary, I think you have something you'd like to say to the class. You wanna hop up and say it?\nB: Okay.

I'm seven.\nC: That would be your grandmother.\nB: Holy shit!\nC: So let me guess. Our lovely principal, Ms. Davis.\nD: Never get on the bad side of small-minded people who have a little authority. I thought I taught you that.\nC: What are you doin' here?\nD: You don't think I have the right to see my granddaughter?\nC: I do. I'm thrilled your seven-year exhaustive search has finally come to a fruitful conclusion.\nD: I don't think this is an appropriate time to talk. So, are you teaching?\nC: I repair boats.\nD: Please.\nC: I'm not bad at it either.\nD: Well, then, that explains this. They don't sell sunscreen here?\nC: I wear sunscreen.\nD: Not enough. And you need a hat. A big hat that shades your face and neck.\nC: Okay. I appreciate the advice. I do. But we're not here to talk about sunscreen, are we? \nD: Oh, so no more small talk? That's a shame. Okay. The environment you have created for that child where she lives, the school she attends, it's substandard, every bit of it.\nC: I disagree.\nD: We're getting nowhere if we're not gonna be honest with each other.\nC: I am being honest.\nD: I see. Fine. Well, I'm not leaving without her.\nC: Well, welcome to Florida.\nD: Frank, please listen to reason. At some point, either you're gonna come to the conclusion, or someone in authority is going to spell it out for you that the child's best interest is all that matters.\nC: You're gonna make me pull rank, I will. Diane didn't want you to have her.\nD: Diane didn't always think things through. And what do you think she'd say if she saw how her child is living now? Do you honestly think she'd be pleased?\nC: That she's living a somewhat normal life? Yes. I do.\nD: She is not normal. And treating her as such is negligence on a grand scale. I know your heart's in the right place on this. But you are denying the girl her potential. You are. I can provide for her. I can enrich her life.\nC: Oh, come on, Evelyn. You're gonna take that girl, you're gonna bury her in tutors...\nD: And you'd bury her under a rock. Look, I don't expect you to understand the price you have to pay for greatness.\nC: Oh, I do. That's why I have Mary in the first place.\nD: That's uncalled for. Your sister had a laundry list of problems. She was weak. Weak like her father and weak like...Well.\nC: Now, if it's who I think it is... Kinda puts a black cloud over our luncheon.\nD: You're still stubborn and vindictive.\nE: You guys ready to order?\nD: Here's an idea. Stop thinking about me and you and start thinking about what's best for the child. For any reasonable person, a clear picture will emerge. If it doesn't, I suggest you call your attorney.\nF: Okay. Adler, grandmother and uncle. Really? You sure you folks don't wanna go out in the hallway and settle this? No? Well, that's a shame. Mr. Cullen, you are here for the uncle.\nG: Yes, sir, Your Honor.\nF: For the record, Mrs. Dibbons is representing the State of Florida Child Welfare Department. Proceed.\nH: Your Honor, my client, Mrs. Adler is the maternal grandmother of the child. Her daughter, the girl's mother, was a troubled woman who seven years ago, sadly, took her own life. It was at this time that Mr. Adler preemptively and illegally took custody of the girl and spirited her across state lines for the purpose of denying my client custody. Now, there is evidence that the child currently lives in unclean and unwholesome conditions. We petition the court to grant my client full custody of the child so that she may be returned to the state of Massachusetts and given the care to which she is entitled.\nG: My client took an infant under his wing for one reason only. It was his sister's desire that he do so. My client has been her constant caregiver. And, Your Honor, as far as the living conditions, I've been in this home. It's fine.\nF: All right. Last chance before this starts costing a lot more money.\nH: Your Honor, my client would need reasonable access to the child.\nF: So ordered. Ms. Dibbons, you'll go over there and check out the living conditions?\nJ: On the books, Your Honor.\nF: All right, folks. Drive carefully.\nC: Her lawyer has a nice suit.\nG: Relax, Frank. More weight's put on the talent competition. Go have a cocktail, hmm? \nC: Roberta, would you like to have Mary tonight?\nK: Why wouldn't I like to have Mary tonight? I told you something like this would happen. Now look where we are. And I'm supposed to believe you know what you're doing. You couldn't even find a white lawyer.\nC: Wow. Look, just...Don't worry, okay?\nK: Don't tell me that. There's nothing you can say that's gonna make me feel good because I have no say in any of this, Frank. I'm not a blood relative, I'm not a legal guardian. I'm nothing! Just the lady who lives next door, whose opinion means nothing, whose feelings mean nothing. Would I like to have Mary tonight?

Just copy it exactly as you see it written.\nC: But it's...\nD: Exactly as written. Thank you.\nB: So, what's this problem I'm supposed to look at?\nA: I don't know.\nB: Is it like the problems Mom worked on?\nA: Your mother didn't work on problems. She worked on just one problem.\nB: Just one? Her entire life?\nA: Most of it. Look. These are the Millennium Problems. Seven great and meaningful problems. Some mathematicians have worked their entire lives to prove them.\nB: Who's the dude with the beard?\nA: That's not a dude. That's Grigori Perelman. He proved the Poincaré conjecture. The only one of the seven proved. This is your mother's problem.\nB: No picture. She didn't solve it?\nA: No. She was close. She would have won the Fields Medal and probably shared a Nobel.\nB: Maybe I'll have my picture up here someday.\nA: If you really desire it, you can have your picture there, darling. I can help you. It takes focus and hard work, but if you succeed, your name will live forever.\nA: Don't be smug, Seymore.\nD: Well, she's had plenty of time.\nA: She traveled yesterday. She slept in a strange bed. Give her a chance. At six years old, she read Zimmer.\nD: Outstanding. How much did she comprehend? So, Mary, I see you're looking at our little problem.\nB: Little? It's big.\nD: Yeah.\nB: Why are you so mad all of a sudden?\nA: I'm not mad. I'm annoyed. Not with you, dear. With that pompous ass, Shankland.\nB: I knew that guy was gonna have a beard before we even went in there. Math teachers like to grow beards.\nA: I should never have agreed to this in the first place. Did he really expect you to just walk in and be able to dissect some random, massive problem?\nB: Not much to dissect, if you ask me.\nA: Why? Why do you say that?\nB: It was wrong.\nA: What?\nB: Well, for starters, he forgot the negative sign on the exponent. It went downhill from there. The problem was unsolvable. Maybe this school isn't as great as you think it is.\nD: Mary, you knew the problem was incorrect. Why didn't you say anything?\nB: Frank says I'm not supposed to correct older people. Nobody likes a smart-ass.\nB: Frank, I think this is stupid. Why don't we just call Evelyn and tell her I don't wanna do this?\nE: Because like I told you, Evelyn didn't order this. The court did. So again, what are we gonna do?\nB: Tell the truth.\nE: Exactly. Sooner we answer these questions, sooner we get to go home. So, no attitude, okay?\nB: Okay.\nF: Hi, Mary. I'm Pat Golding, but you can call me Pat if you like.\nB: Got it.\nF: Do you know why you're here? I mean has anyone told you what this is about?\nB: My grandmother wants me to live with her and I wanna stay with Frank.\nF: That's correct. I'm sure this can all be very scary stuff. Does any of it worry you?\nB: Nope. Frank says I'm not goin' anywhere.\nF: Your uncle told you you're not going anywhere?\nB: Just 15 minutes ago. So, we done here?\nF: Not quite yet.\nB: My best friend other than Frank and Fred is Roberta who lives a couple houses away.\nF: Really? What's she like?\nB: She's nice and funny. And I love her.\nF: That's nice. Is Roberta your only friend your age?\nB: Roberta's not my age. She's like 40, 50, 30-something.\nF: Roberta's a grown woman?\nB: People my age are boring. Roberta's cool.\nF: Okay.\nB: I think if you guys knew Frank, you'd leave us alone. He can be pretty annoying, but he's a good person. I think.\nF: Why do you say that?\nB: He wanted me before I was smart.\nG: Where are you currently employed? \nE: I repair boats.\nG: Oh, really? At which marina?\nE: I don't work at a marina. I freelance. \nG: So, safe to say, no health insurance. \nE: No.\nG: About a week before your sister took her life, what were you doing for a living then?\nE: I was a teacher.\nG: You're being modest, aren't you? You were a professor at Boston University. Isn't that right?\nE: Yes, well, Assistant Professor.\nG: And what'd you teach?\nE: Philosophy.\nG: Truth and logic. That sort of thing. Your attorney said that the primary reason that you took Mary is because it was what your sister would have wanted you to do. Is that the truth? \nE: Yes.\nG: Mary has been identified as a math prodigy. But her formal math education under your care she's learning at the first grade level, isn't she? \nE: Yes.\nG: And you turned down a scholarship at the Oaks, a school specializing in the education of gifted children?\nE: Yes.\nG: And Diane, she'd be fine with that? You've uprooted that little girl and brought her here for one reason only... to do harm to your mother. You blamed her for your sister.\nE: No, I don't.\nG: And Mary to you is just a pawn in all this. Isn't she?\nE: Diane wanted Mary to be a kid. She wanted her to have a life. She wanted her to have friends and to play and to be
